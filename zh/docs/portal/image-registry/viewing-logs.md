# Viewing Logs

ECP keeps a log of your registry projects. The log contains a date- and time-stamped record of the operations performed by registry users. The following procedure describes how to view logs.

1. In the left pane, click **Image Registry > Registry Projects**.
2. Perform one of the following tasks:<ul><li>Click a project's **Actions** button and select **Logs**.</ul></li> <ul><li>Click a project's name to display its details page. To view the project's logs, click the **Logs** button at the top right.</ul></li>
The Access Logs box lists the log entries associated with the selected project. The most current entries appear at the top of the list. Filters at the top of the page allow you to filter entries by registry user, operation, resource type, resource name, and time range.<br>
