# Welcome to the Edge Computing Platform Customer Portal

The Edge Computing Platform (ECP) Customer Portal is a web-based user interface for the ECP platform. You can use the portal to deploy your containerized applications to ECP locations, inspect/troubleshoot your applications, and manage global traffic for the applications. You can also use the portal to retrieve real-time reports about the usage of compute, network, and storage resources provisioned by the ECP.

**Note**: The ECP is a multi-cluster container orchestration platform built on top of [Docker](<https://www.docker.com/>) and [Kubernetes](<https://kubernetes.io/>). If you are not familiar with these systems, it is strongly recommended that you read the official [Docker](<https://docs.docker.com/>) and [Kubernetes](<https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/>) documentation before continuing with the ECP.

## ECP Features

- Good compatibility with native Kubernetes API
- Rich API and intuitive management console
- Easy access to compute, network and storage resources at the edge enabled by automatic application delivery around the globe
- Full application lifecycle management, covering build, deployment, update, scaling and troubleshooting, etc
- DNS-based intelligent global traffic management
- Images registry service that stores and secures container images and accelerates images upload and download
- A network of over 55 edge PoPs which keeps growing
