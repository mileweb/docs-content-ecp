7. Click **Submit & Deploy**.<br>

**Note:** The application deployment process will take a while, the length depending on the size of container images to be downloaded, the target locations, and the number of expected instances, etc. Once the application is deployed, **Deployed** appears as its status on the Applications page. To check the status and other details, use the applications list view and detail view. After the application is deployed, you can [check application instances](</docs/portal/applications/retrieving-instances-of-an-application.md>). If you encounter a problem, [try to troubleshoot](</docs/portal/applications/troubleshooting-an-application.md>).
