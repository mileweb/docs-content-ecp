# Deleting a CNAME

The following procedure describes how to delete CNAMEs from the CNAMEs page. You can also delete CNAMEs from the form used to [view CNAME information](</docs/portal/cnames/viewing-cname-information.md>).

1. In the left pane, click **CNAMEs**.
2. Click the **Actions** drop-down list of the CNAME you want to delete, and then select **Delete**. 
3. When prompted to confirm the deletion, click **Yes, delete!** to delete the CNAME.

**Note:** After a CNAME is deleted, the ECP will stop routing traffic for the associated application. Make sure you've changed the DNS record(s) for your application before deleting the CNAME.
