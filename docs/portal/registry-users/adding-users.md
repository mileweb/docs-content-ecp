| **Field**              | **Description**                                |
| -----------------------|------------------------------------------------| 
| Username           | Prefix to be used as part of the registry user's username. The username can contain up to 15 characters, but no special characters such as a ^, ", ~, #, $, and %. To avoid naming collisions across registry users of different customers, ECP appends a fixed-length random string to this prefix to form a complete username when it creates the new registry user.                                                            |
| Password               | Case-sensitive password for the new registry user. The password must be 8 to 20 characters long and have at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one number.                  |
| Confirm Password       | Same case-sensitive password typed in the **Password** field.                                                      |
| Email                  | Email address for the new registry user.      |
| Description            | Optional description about the new registry user (up to 20 characters).                                                   |
| Access to Projects     | Select the projects that will be accessible to the new registry user and the new registry user's access type. Choices are:<ul><li>Allow readOnly access to all existing projects = registry user can only pull images from a project registry.</ul></li><ul><li>Allow readWrite access to all existing projects = registry user can pull images from and push images to a project registry.</ul></li><ul><li>Custom permissions = select the projects available to this registry user, and whether the registry user has readOnly or read/Write permission.</ul></li>                                    |
