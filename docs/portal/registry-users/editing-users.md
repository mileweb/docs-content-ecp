# Editing Registry Users

Editing a registry user allows you to see basic information about the user along with the projects associated with the user. Editing also allows you to edit the repositories associated with the user. Buttons at the top right of the Edit page allow you to [change the user's password](</docs/portal/registry-users/changing-passwords.md>), [delete the user](</docs/portal/registry-users/deleting-users.md>), and [update the user](</docs/portal/registry-users/updating-users.md>).

To edit a registry user:
1. In the left pane, click **Image Registry > Registry Users**.
2. On the Registry Users page, click the name of the user you want to edit. The Edit page appears.<ul><li>The top fields are read-only and show basic information about the user.</ul></li><ul><li>A table in the **Access to Project** field shows the projects and permissions associated with the user. </ul></li>
