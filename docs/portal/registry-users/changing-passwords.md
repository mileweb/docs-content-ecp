# Changing Passwords

The following procedure describes how to change the password for registry users. A valid password must be 8 to 20 characters long and have at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one number. To make sure the password is changed for the appropriate registry user, the registry user's information can be viewed before the password is changed.
