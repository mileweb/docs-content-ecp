7. Click **Submit & Deploy**.<br>

**Note:** The application deployment process may take up to a few minutes, depending on the size of container images to be pulled, the target locations, and the number of expected instances. Once the application is deployed, **Deployed** appears as its status on the Applications page. To check the status and other details, use the applications list view and detail view. After the application is deployed, you can retrieve instances in [list view](</docs/portal/applications/retrieving-instances-of-an-application.md#retrieving-instances-of-an-application-in-list-view>) or [map view](</docs/portal/applications/retrieving-instances-of-an-application.md#retrieving-instances-of-an-application-in-map-view>). If you encounter a problem, [troubleshoot the application](</docs/portal/applications/troubleshooting-an-application.md>).
