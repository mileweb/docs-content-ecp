# Managing Applications

Application management allows you to configure your containerized applications one time, and then deploy your applications to ECP locations across the globe.

Applications are managed from the Applications page. To display this page, click **Applications** in the left pane. The following figure shows the key elements on the page, and the table following the figure describes them.
