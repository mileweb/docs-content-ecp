# Managing Registry Projects

A registry project contains image repositories. You can use a project to group repositories that have a similar purpose, such as repositories for the same application or for the same organization. These groupings also allow you to manage access control for your projects.

## Registry Projects Page
Projects are managed from the Registry Projects page. To display this page, click **Image Registry > Registry Projects** in the left pane.

The following figure shows the key elements on the page, and the table following the figure describes them.
