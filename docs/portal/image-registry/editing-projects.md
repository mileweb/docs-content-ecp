# Editing Projects

Editing a project allows you to see a project's basic information and the repositories associated with it. Editing also allows you to change the description of the repositories, view detailed vulnerability information, and delete tags and repositories. Buttons at the top right of the Edit page allow you to [view logs](</docs/portal/image-registry/viewing-logs.md>), [delete the project](</docs/portal/image-registry/deleting-projects.md>), and [update the project](</docs/portal/image-registry/updating-projects.md>).
**Note:** If you have many projects, use the **Enter a project** field to filter projects. The **Reset** button clears the filter.

To edit a project:
1. In the left pane, click **Image Registry > Registry Projects**.
